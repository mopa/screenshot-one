# ScreenshotOne Bash Script

[ScreenshotOne](https://screenshotone.com/) is a great service that will take screenshots of any website and has the ability to block the cookie banners and ads. This is a simple bash script for taking the screenshots. It is under development and all suggestions are welcome.

## Usage

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

2. Get the access key (you can find it in your account of ScreenshotOne service), then paste in the `.env` file.

3. Run the script:

```bash
screenshotone <url of the website>
```

This will produce a file named `screenshot.jpg` in the same folder of the script.
